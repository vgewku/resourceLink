        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Finding help shouldn't be a struggle. Too many people spend hours searching for food banks, childcare, legal aid, or job support—only to find outdated information or services at capacity. At the same time, local organizations work tirelessly to serve their communities but struggle to reach those in need. <strong>We built ResourceLink to bridge that gap, making it easier for people to find resources and for providers to connect with the right audience.</strong></p>

    <section class="commitment">
        <h2>Commitment to Authenticity</h2>
        <p>Our platform simplifies the search for essential services by matching users with available resources in their area. Instead of endless calls and guesswork, people can quickly find the help they need, when they need it. <strong>For service providers, we offer a space to be seen and utilized, ensuring their impact reaches as many people as possible.</strong> Because when communities are connected, <strong>everyone benefits.</strong></p>
